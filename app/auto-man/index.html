Read our guidelines for information about what\'s okay to post and what\'s not.</p><h3 tabindex="0">Dealing with the Media</h3><p tabindex="0">If you\'re ever put in a position where someone from the media asks you to speak for us, decline unless you\'ve been authorized and had training on how to talk to the media. If you get a call from the media, refer the caller to our PR department.</p><h3 tabindex="0">Apply Knowledge</h3><p tabindex="0">Is my communication professional?

We have safety programs tailored to our headquarters and field offices, stores and distribution centers. If you see something that seems unsafe, or if you witness any kind of incident that endangers the safety of team members, report it immediately to your supervisor or another manager.</p><h3 tabindex="0">Drugs and Alcohol</h3><p tabindex="0">A safe workplace isn\'t just about best practices, equipment and training. Safety also relates to team members\' behavior at work. We take pride in having team members who are committed to superior guest service, productivity and teamwork, and we recognize that drug and alcohol use can interfere with all of those things â€“ so Target maintains a work environment that\'s drug- and alcohol-free. If you suspect drug or alcohol use on the job, or feel threatened by another person\'s actions or words, talk to your supervisor immediately.</p><h3 tabindex="0">Violence</h3><p tabindex="0"></p><h3 tabindex="0">Apply Knowledge</h3><p tabindex="0">Is there potential for injury or property damage if this isn\'t corrected?

After touring our fascility, checking records and receipts, and testing equipment, the inspector left a list of action items.  We responded in writing to OSHA\'s list; as a result, OSHA noted that all the issues were resolved and the building was in compliance.</p><h3 tabindex="0">Cooperate to Operate</h3><p tabindex="0">We are subject to audits or inspections by the government agencies that regulate our business. The people who want to check out how we work might be from the federal government or from a state or local office, and they could be looking at anything from safety issues to whether we comply with local fire codes. Their inspections or audits could include looking at our files and records, making on-site inspections, or submitting requests for information.</p><h3 tabindex="0">How Should I React?</h3><p tabindex="0">Because we comply with the laws and regulations that apply to our business, we\'re always willing to cooperate with auditors and inspectors. If you\'re part of a team that gets a request for information or an inspection, you should:</p><ul tabindex="0"><li tabindex="0">Contact your supervisor to notify them of the inspection. Be sure to follow the inspection procedures for your area and report the request to other partners who need to know.</li><li tabindex="0">Provide the appropriate information requested quickly and accurately. Do not provide the inspector with any original documents to take with them, but you can let them look at the documents or make copies. If you don\'t have the information at hand or you are uncomfortable with the request, it\'s okay to let the inspectors know you\'ll get back to them.</li><li tabindex="0">Quickly handle any action items the inspector leaves with you. That builds trust with the agencies that regulate us and shows them that we\'re serious about our compliance obligations. Work with our partners before completing any agency follow-up.</li><li tabindex="0">Refer non-routine information requests (e.g., subpoenas and search warrants) by government entities to our Law Department.</li></ul><h3 tabindex="0">Apply Knowledge</h3><p tabindex="0">Am I showing my willingness to work with the inspectors?

It sounded too good to be true, and it was. The potential renter revealed that he was a vendor who wanted to do more business with us. He hoped his generous offer would influence Maya to order more product from his company. Maya told the vendor no way, contacted her manager and reported the situation to our report link. After an investigation, the would-be renter\'s business relationship was terminated.</p><h3 tabindex="0">Don\'t be Swayed</h3><p tabindex="0">Avoiding conflicts of interest means you\'re responsible for ensuring that you don\'t make business decisions based on how they might benefit you. We not only avoid conflicts of interest, we avoid engaging in activities that could create even the appearance of a conflict of interest. For example, we avoid activities that could suggest that a vendor has somehow improperly influenced our team members in order to receive favorable treatment.</p><h3 tabindex="0">It Could Be a Conflict of Interest if you:</h3><ul tabindex="0"><li tabindex="0">Have a substantial financial interest in any company that does business with us, wants to do business or competes with us.</li><li tabindex="0">Perform any services (e.g., consulting or serving on the board of directors) for any company that does business with us, wants to do business with us or competes with us.</li><li tabindex="0">Represent us in a transaction with any company in which you or a member of your family have an interest.</li><li tabindex="0">Compete with us in the sale or purchase of property.</li><li tabindex="0">Solicit, accept or be reimbursed for any personal gifts, favors, travel, housing, services, excessive meals or entertainment, or anything else of value from any company that does business with us, wants to do business with us or competes with us. (There are some exceptions; for instance, you can accept a vendor\'s invitation to a meal if the purpose is business-related and the cost is reasonable.)</li><li tabindex="0">Participate with a vendor in any activity that could result in personal gain.</li><li tabindex="0">Take merchandise samples for non-business use.</li><li tabindex="0">Misuse your position to make any purchases for personal use.</li></ul><h3 tabindex="0">Apply Knowledge</h3><p tabindex="0">Could this activity influence my business decisions?

He offered to pick up the tab and discovered that his personal credit card wasn\'t in his wallet â€“ but he had his Company Purchasing Card, so he used that instead. The same day, a team member named Kim overheard a colleague at headquarters say that a vendor who\'d sent some product samples didn\'t want them back, so Kim took the samples home. Meanwhile, Pat, a team member working in her store\'s backroom, slipped a new iPod into her pocket, thinking that nobody would notice. Fellow team members reported each of these instances to the link, and we launched investigations into all of them.</p><h3 tabindex="0">Use As Directed</h3><p tabindex="0">Our assets â€“ no matter whether they\'re merchandise, vendor samples, corporate credit cards, cash or information â€“ are intended to be used for the benefit of the company. We have accounting, reporting and internal controls and teams in place to detect theft, fraud or misuse of company assets. When theft does occur, we investigate and resolve each incident quickly.</p><h3 tabindex="0">Report Misuse of Assets</h3><p tabindex="0">It\'s a pretty good bet that you already know your role in protecting our assets. If you don\'t, read the company\'s policies. If you see somebody stealing, or if you become aware of misuse of company assets, alert your supervisor, Assets Protection or the Employee Relations and Integrity Hotline.</p><h3 tabindex="0">Apply Knowledge</h3><p tabindex="0">Could someone view my actions as theft?

After Jeff retired, his replacement got a question from a vendor about a contract. As she went through Jeff\'s files, she found eight different versions of the document in e-mail archives, in filing cabinets and in off-site storage.</p><p tabindex="0">But she couldn\'t find the final, signed version, and neither could the vendor. The vendor disagreed about which version was meant to be final, which led to unwanted renegotiations, many expenses and lost productivity as team members sorted through the documents and eventually resolved the dispute.</p><h3 tabindex="0">To Keep or Not to Keep?</h3><p tabindex="0">Many of us collect a lot of information in the course of doing our jobs â€“ e-mails, memos, spreadsheets, contracts, proposals, project plans.</p><p tabindex="0">The list goes on and the documents stack up. If you don\'t know how long you\'re supposed to keep that information, you risk keeping it too long or getting rid of it too soon. Cleaning out your files might result in discarding information that we need to keep, while keeping documents too long can result in confusion and an overstuffed electronic archive.</p><h3 tabindex="0">Reach Out for Help</h3><p tabindex="0">We have an obligation to ensure that our records are kept for the required amount of time. Talk to your supervisor to be sure that you understand the legal requirements and company expectations for keeping documents for which you\'re responsible, and the right way to dispose of documents we\'re no longer required to keep. You can also contact Records Management for a copy of our corporate records retention schedule.</p><h3 tabindex="0">Apply Knowledge</h3><p tabindex="0">Should I keep this document?

When she got back to her office, she contacted a vendor to have them make something that looked just like it. The product hit stores in record time â€“ but when a rep for the vendor from the trade show saw the item at our store, she sounded the alarm. This product wasn\'t similar to the trade show item â€“&nbsp;it was identical to the trade show item! The manufacturer complained and we wound up removing all the product from stores, which satisfied the other company but cost us a lot of money.</p><h3 tabindex="0">Original Intent</h3><p tabindex="0">We thrive on innovation. Our team generates so many new ideas with so many sources of inspiration that we have to be careful not to infringe on the intellectual property rights of others. We respect others\' intellectual property rights and know that even an allegation of infringement could be costly and hurt our reputation.</p><h3 tabindex="0">Whose Idea is it?</h3><p tabindex="0">If you\'re involved in creating new campaigns, programs or innovations for Target, it\'s important to steer clear of other companies\' and individuals\' rights â€“ not only in design but also in the development of written materials, video, music, software and other technology. You should also remember that Target owns what you come up with while you work here.</p><h3 tabindex="0">Apply Knowledge</h3><p tabindex="0">Do I have permission to use this?
