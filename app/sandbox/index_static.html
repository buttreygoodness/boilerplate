          <h2 id="scenario">Scenario</h2>

          <p>Keeping up with online news and passing on relevant stories to his team was part of Frank’s job at Target headquarters. From time to time he also included funny stories to promote a Fast, Fun and Friendly environment. One morning, Frank received a joke from a friend and was getting ready to forward it to his team when he realized that it made fun of immigrants. Frank knew it wasn’t right for him to pass on that kind of content, so he deleted the email. By doing so, he avoided an investigation into whether he had violated our Harassment-Free Workplace Policy.</p>

          <h2 id="welcome_one_welcome_all">Welcome One, Welcome All</h2>

          <p>Discrimination and harassment aren’t tolerated, period—in hiring, training, advancement, compensation, discipline or termination. For starters, discrimination and harassment are illegal. But they’re also counter to everything we stands for.</p>

          <h2 id="diversity">Diversity</h2>

          <p>Part of what makes us so unique is our commitment to building a diverse team. Different people with different backgrounds have different ways of seeing the world and different tools for solving problems. The more diverse our team, the more likely we are to hit on the great, game-changing ideas that make us one of the most innovative companies in the industry.</p>

          <h2 id="equality_opportunity_employer">Equality Opportunity Employer</h2>

          <p>We're an Equal Opportunity Employer; we train team members and managers on what that means, including your right to be protected from retaliation if you make a good-faith complaint of discrimination or harassment, participate in an investigation of such conduct or oppose unlawful practices.</p>

          <p>“OMG I AM HAVING SUCH A BAD DAY,” Robin’s blog post began... which would have been an okay way to vent if she’d left it at that. However, she also posted unflattering cell-phone pictures she’d taken of several guests whom she blamed for her terrible day. A fellow team member who read Robin’s blog posted a comment that Robin should check with about the content of the post; after she gave it additional thought, Robin pulled down the post and requested that Google remove it from its search results.</p>

          <h2 id="boost_our_image">Boost Our Image</h2>

          <p>It’s important for every communication that comes from us to reflect our brand. Communications include everything from internal communications like conversations with fellow team members to external communications like social media posts that relate to working at here. </p>

          <p>We don’t tolerate communications that violate our policies (e.g., our Harassment-Free and Violence-Free Workplace policies) or that are libelous or obscene. Good communication—whether face to face or in writing—is the most important tool in successful collaboration with fellow team members, which is a key ingredient in Target’s culture. It’s okay to disagree with a co-worker, but it’s important to be professional and respectful even when you don’t see eye to eye. </p>

          <h2 id="social_media">Social Media</h2>

          <p>If you choose to publish your opinions or post information about us through social media, you’re responsible for that content and for making it clear that your opinions are your own and not ours. Read our guidelines for information about what’s okay to post and what’s not.</p>

          <h2 id="dealing_with_the_media">Dealing with the Media</h2>

          <p>If you’re ever put in a position where someone from the media asks you to speak for us, decline unless you’ve been authorized and had training on how to talk to the media. If you get a call from the media, refer the caller to our PR department.</p>

          <h2 id="scenario">Scenario</h2>

          <p>Amir works in warehousing. When his manager asked him to fill in for a team member who was out sick, Amir was eager to help. It didn’t take long for him to realize that he was in way over his head because he hadn’t been trained on the equiptment. He talked to his manager about the possible safety issues and found out that she didn’t know Amir lacked the right training. His manager found a trained team member who could fill in, and worked with Human Resources to get Amir the training that would prepare him for the next time his help was needed.</p>

          <h2 id="stay_on_the_safe_side">Stay On the Safe Side</h2>

          <p>Safety has an impact on every part of our business, from team-member satisfaction to productivity and profitability—so keeping team members safe is a top priority. We have safety programs tailored to our headquarters and field offices, stores and distribution centers. If you see something that seems unsafe, or if you witness any kind of incident that endangers the safety of team members, report it immediately to your supervisor or another manager.</p>

          <h2 id="drugs_and_alcohol">Drugs and Alcohol</h2>

          <p>A safe workplace isn’t just about best practices, equipment and training. Safety also relates to team members’ behavior at work. We take pride in having team members who are committed to superior guest service, productivity and teamwork, and we recognize that drug and alcohol use can interfere with all of those things—so Target maintains a work environment that’s drug- and alcohol-free. If you suspect drug or alcohol use on the job, or feel threatened by another person’s actions or words, talk to your supervisor immediately.</p>

          <h2 id="violence">Violence</h2>

          <p>Team-member safety also requires a workplace that’s violence-free, so we don’t tolerate workplace violence under any circumstances. Violence includes actions or words that endanger or harm a person or Target property, or that lead other team members to believe that any person or their property is in danger.</p>

          <p>Is there potential for injury or property damage if this isn’t corrected? Could someone see my words or actions as threatening?</p>

          <h2 id="scenario">Scenario</h2>

          <p>An inspector from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) arrived at our office one morning for a surprise inspection. After touring our fascility, checking records and receipts, and testing equipment, the inspector left a list of action items.  We responded in writing to OSHA’s list; as a result, OSHA noted that all the issues were resolved and the building was in compliance.</p>

          <h2 id="cooperate_to_operate">Cooperate to Operate</h2>

          <p>We are subject to audits or inspections by the government agencies that regulate our business. The people who want to check out how we work might be from the federal government or from a state or local office, and they could be looking at anything from safety issues to whether we comply with local fire codes. Their inspections or audits could include looking at our files and records, making on-site inspections, or submitting requests for information.</p>

          <h2 id="how_should_i_react">How Should I React?</h2>

          <p>Because we comply with the laws and regulations that apply to our business, we’re always willing to cooperate with auditors and inspectors. If you’re part of a team that gets a request for information or an inspection, you should:</p>

          <ul>
          <li>Contact your supervisor to notify them of the inspection. Be sure to follow the inspection procedures for your area and report the request to other partners who need to know.</li>
          <li>Provide the appropriate information requested quickly and accurately. Do not provide the inspector with any original documents to take with them, but you can let them look at the documents or make copies. If you don’t have the information at hand or you are uncomfortable with the request, it’s okay to let the inspectors know you’ll get back to them.</li>
          <li>Quickly handle any action items the inspector leaves with you. That builds trust with the agencies that regulate us and shows them that we’re serious about our compliance obligations. Work with our partners before completing any agency follow-up.</li>
          <li>Refer non-routine information requests (e.g., subpoenas and search warrants) by government entities to our Law Department.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Maya couldn’t believe what she was reading: an e-mail from a business acquaintance offering to pay $3,000 a week to rent the beachfront condo she was offering for $1,000 a week. It sounded too good to be true, and it was. The potential renter revealed that he was a vendor who wanted to do more business with us. He hoped his generous offer would influence Maya to order more product from his company. Maya told the vendor no way, contacted her manager and reported the situation to our report link. After an investigation, the would-be renter’s business relationship was terminated.</p>

          <h2 id="don8217t_be_swayed">Don't Be Swayed</h2>

          <p>Avoiding conflicts of interest means you’re responsible for ensuring that you don’t make business decisions based on how they might benefit you. We not only avoid conflicts of interest, we avoid engaging in activities that could create even the appearance of a conflict of interest. For example, we avoid activities that could suggest that a vendor has somehow improperly influenced our team members in order to receive favorable treatment.</p>

          <li>Solicit, accept or be reimbursed for any personal gifts, favors, travel, housing, services, excessive meals or entertainment, or anything else of value from any company that does business with us, wants to do business with us or competes with us. (There are some exceptions; for instance, you can accept a vendor’s invitation to a meal if the purpose is business-related and the cost is reasonable.)</li>
          <li>Participate with a vendor in any activity that could result in personal gain.</li>
          <li>Take merchandise samples for non-business use.</li>

          <p>John was having dinner one evening with friends. He offered to pick up the tab and discovered that his personal credit card wasn’t in his wallet—but he had his Company Purchasing Card, so he used that instead. The same day, a team member named Kim overheard a colleague at headquarters say that a vendor who’d sent some product samples didn’t want them back, so Kim took the samples home. Meanwhile, Pat, a team member working in her store’s backroom, slipped a new iPod into her pocket, thinking that nobody would notice. Fellow team members reported each of these instances to the link, and we launched investigations into all of them.</p>

          <h2 id="use_as_directed">Use As Directed</h2>

          <p>Our assets—no matter whether they’re merchandise, vendor samples, corporate credit cards, cash or information—are intended to be used for the benefit of the company. We have accounting, reporting and internal controls and teams in place to detect theft, fraud or misuse of company assets. When theft does occur, we investigate and resolve each incident quickly.</p>

          <h2 id="report_misuse_of_assets">Report Misuse of Assets</h2>

          <p>It’s a pretty good bet that you already know your role in protecting our assets. If you don’t, read the company’s policies. If you see somebody stealing, or if you become aware of misuse of company assets, alert your supervisor, Assets Protection or the Employee Relations and Integrity Hotline.</p>

          <h2 id="scenario">Scenario</h2>

          <p>Jeff was an employee for over 30 years— and he kept almost every scrap of information that ever crossed his desk, including multiple versions of contracts and other documents. After Jeff retired, his replacement got a question from a vendor about a contract. As she went through Jeff’s files, she found eight different versions of the document in e-mail archives, in filing cabinets and in off-site storage... but she couldn’t find the final, signed version, and neither could the vendor. The vendor disagreed about which version was meant to be final, which led to unwanted renegotiations, many expenses and lost productivity as team members sorted through the documents and eventually resolved the dispute.</p>

          <h2 id="to_keep_or_not_to_keep">To Keep or Not to Keep?</h2>

          <p>Many of us collect a lot of information in the course of doing our jobs—e-mails, memos, spreadsheets, contracts, proposals, project plans... the list goes on and the documents stack up. If you don’t know how long you’re supposed to keep that information, you risk keeping it too long or getting rid of it too soon. Cleaning out your files might result in discarding information that we need to keep, while keeping documents too long can result in confusion and an overstuffed electronic archive.</p>

          <h2 id="reach_out_for_help">Reach Out for Help</h2>

          <p>We have an obligation to ensure that our records are kept for the required amount of time. Talk to your supervisor to be sure that you understand the legal requirements and company expectations for keeping documents for which you’re responsible, and the right way to dispose of documents we’re no longer required to keep. You can also contact Records Management for a copy of our corporate records retention schedule.</p>

          <p>Chris fell in love with a product she saw at a trade show. When she got back to her office, she contacted a vendor to have them make something that looked just like it. The product hit stores in record time—but when a rep for the vendor from the trade show saw the item at our store, she sounded the alarm. This product wasn’t similar to the trade show item—it was identical to the trade show item! The manufacturer complained and we wound up removing all the product from stores, which satisfied the other company but cost us a lot of money.</p>

          <h2 id="original_intent">Original Intent</h2>

          <p>We thrive on innovation. Our team generates so many new ideas with so many sources of inspiration that we have to be careful not to infringe on the intellectual property rights of others. We respect others’ intellectual property rights and know that even an allegation of infringement could be costly and hurt our reputation.</p>

          <p>If you’re involved in creating new campaigns, programs or innovations for Target, it’s important to steer clear of other companies’ and individuals’ rights—not only in design but also in the development of written materials, video, music, software and other technology. You should also remember that Target owns what you come up with while you work here.</p>
